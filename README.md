## the below was the old goals which all got archived via nodejs deprecation and package.json deprecation.
Repository for discussion on how to help ensure baseline
maintenance and ability to safely use key packages in the
ecosystem with current Node.js versions. You can find more
about this initiative in the article:
[Call to Action: Accelerating Node.js Growth](https://medium.com/@nodejs/call-to-action-accelerating-node-js-growth-e4862bee2919)

## Goals

* Define and document how to prioritize which packages are key to the
  Node.js ecosystem, and how/what assistance can/should be provided.
  One key aspect is understanding what communication
  channels are needed in order to identify when specific
  issues are slowing migration from one Node.js version to another,
  or causing friction in the ecosystem.
  - deprecated via not using package json that allows people to directly build software depending on the git hash and compose out of git repos directly.

* Building and documenting guidance, tools and processes so
  businesses can identify the packages they depend on.
  Businesses can use the information to build a business
  case which supports both the organization and developers helping to
  maintain those packages.

* Documenting a backlog and providing resources to help
  businesses identify how their developers can contribute, and
  get engaged. Developers can test and validate a workflow to help
  with issues slowing migration to Node.js 10.x.

* Building, documenting and evangelizing guidance, tools and
  processes (for example LTS for modules)
  can make it easier for maintainers to manage multiple
  streams, and accept help from those who depend on their module.
