All of which take time and resources to research, setup, and maintain.  That time takes away from actual support and maintenance of the modules themselves.\r\n\r\nAs an example, on Express we have talked about setting up GH issue templates, helpful bots and other things like this.  But because the main contributors prioritize the immediate need of doing security patches, responding to user support requests, reviewing PRs, and discussion of new features those things don't get done.  In a large community like Express, there are tons of repo's we would need to set this up for, making a small job for each into a big one for the whole group.\r\n\r\nIf there was a great template, guide, or even a team which could go around and do this for us, it would be super helpful.  Is there is an automated way to add this?  What about keeping them all updated as the standard changes?

Therefore, I feel it'd be ideal if this initiative could widen its scope to trying to put in place systems/assistance which could be applicable to all packages.\r\n\r\nObviously, it'd be an impossible task to make active interventions on thousands of packages, but what I'm trying to suggest is that it'd be useful to bear in mind a wider scope when discussing how to tackle this problem.\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n\r\n[react-loadable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loadable) is a module which gets 250k weekly downloads, and has been unmaintained for some time including unfixed bugs. 250k evidences a large user base, and judging by the number of open PRs, many motivated would-be contributors - enough I expect to keep the package maintained if they were able to.\r\n\r\nBut I don't imagine that it's big enough to be considered \"key\" in the way an express or mocha would.\r\n\r\nOnly a fraction of node's user-base will use react-loadable. But I would hazard a guess that pretty much *every* node user depends on some other mid-level package like it. So the experience of using node overall depends not just \"key\" packages, but a large range of packages.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is already obvious, but I thought I'd make it explicit.\r\n\r\nI have a couple of specific suggestions which I'll raise as separate issues as soon as I get a chance, but just wanted to drop this in now in case it's a useful perspective.\r\n\r\nAlso, just to say, I think this is a great initiative. The burden of maintenance, and the mess of duplicated, abandoned, and half-done packages littering npm that it causes, is the biggest pain point with node.

the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.\r\n\r\n* Agree on standard meeting process\r\n* Discuss recurring meeting times\r\n* Review initial goals and identify first steps\r\n  * Define and document how to prioritize which packages are key to the\r\n    Node.js ecosystem and how/what assistance can/should be provided.\r\n    One of the key aspects of this is understanding what communication\r\n    channels we need in order to be able to identify when specific\r\n    issues are slowing migration from one Node.js version to another\r\n    or causing friction in the ecosystem in some other way.\r\n  * Building and documenting guidance, tools and processes that\r\n    businesses can use to identify packages on which they depend,\r\n    and then to use this information to be able to build a business\r\n    case that supports their organization and developers helping to\r\n    maintain those packages. \r\n  * Documenting a backlog and providing resources that help\r\n    businesses identify how their developers can ramp up and\r\n    get engaged to help. Test and validate a workflow by helping\r\n    with some issues that are slowing migration to Node.js 10.x.\r\n  * Building, documenting and evangelizing guidance, tools and\r\n    processes (for example LTS for modules)\r\n    that make it easier for maintainers to manage multiple\r\n    streams and accept help from those who depend on their module.\r\n* Process to get sub-teams working\r\n\r\n## Invited\r\n\r\n* Package Maintenance team: @nodejs/package-maintenance\r\n\r\n### Observers/Guests\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nThe agenda comes from issues labelled with `package-maintenance-agenda` across **all of the repositories in the nodejs org**. Please label any additional issues that should be on the agenda before the meeting starts.\r\n\r\n## Joining the meeting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* link for participants: https://zoom.us/j/431077278\r\n* For those who just want to watch: https://www.youtube.com/c/nodejs+foundation/live\r\n* youtube admin page: https://www.youtube.com/my_live_events?filter=scheduled\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/91/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":4,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/91/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/92","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/92/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/92/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/92/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/92","id":390368515,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzOTAzNjg1MTU=","number":92,"title":"Suggestion: add standard methods to limit APIs dependencies can use","user":{"login":"io4","id":9666788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjY3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9666788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/io4","html_url":"https://github.com/io4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/io4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/io4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/io4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/io4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/io4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/io4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/io4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/io4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/io4/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2018-12-12T19:11:49Z","updated_at":"2018-12-13T11:11:48Z","closed_at":"2018-12-13T11:11:48Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I believe it might help to allow packages to set limits on which APIs can be accessed by the dependencies.

We may be able to work with npm, Inc. to utilize this in the CLI or on the website. We might publish our own website. We might publish guidelines or a tool that application and/or package authors can use to analyze their own dependency tree. We could supply a README badge service. The possibilities are endless, but I think it starts with creating a common definition of what we think at-risk looks like.\r\n\r\n*Refs*:\r\n* This would be a prerequisite for #93.\r\n*  I personally think #78 should be reconsidered, but this would be required to make progress on that. I personally think of email as one way to surface the results of this set of heuristics applied to the npm ecosystem, but maybe not the best way.\r\n* The anecdote in #73 is a good example of a case our heuristics should classify as at risk, and collecting more of these anecdotes should help us \"tune\" our algorithm.\r\n* [My comment](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/4#issuecomment-446319259) from earlier is mostly about asking why `npm deprecate` as an opt-in way to signal this sort of information isn't working.\r\n* I think #6 is related insofar as one \"business model\" might be \"completely unfunded and unresourced\".

defined in the `package.json` on npm, all but one or two are hosted on Github, 885 have a `.travis.yml`\r\n- A lot of packages define a list of versions and then add `node` or `stable` or `latest`, but not `lts/*`, so they test in `11` (or `12`), but not in `10`...\r\n- Since node 12 only came out a few days ago, I'm pretty much ignoring it, i.e. `stable`, `latest`, `node` mean `11` for the purposes of version grouping\r\n- Quick and dirty code: https://github.com/dominykas/analyze-npm-top-1000/blob/master/bin/stats/travis-nodes.js\r\n    - I basically downloaded all packuments, then cloned all repos, then parsed the `.travis.yml`, if present and did my best to clean the data up a little bit\r\n    - I tried to extract versions from `matrix` (and `env`), but these may not

doing something like this?\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's reinvent our draft `support` in a best solution ✌\r\n\r\n(I will post my thought in a separate

According to the public stats on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ldapjs):\r\n\r\n+ This package sees almost 50,000 downloads per day\r\n+ This package is directly depended upon by 229 other packages\r\n\r\nAnecdotally, I think you'd have a very hard time finding another package that fills the role this one does within the Node community. Chances are, if you need to interact with an LDAP server via Node then you'll have this package somewhere within your dependency tree.\r\n\r\nThis package seems to be abandoned. It was originally authored by @mcavage, then maintained by @pfmooney, and most recently seems to be under control by @melloc. At this point the package has months old outstanding fundamental issues:\r\n\r\n+ https://github.com/joyent/node-ldapjs/issues/488 -- asking if the project is still maintained with a brief \"I plan to get to it\" from melloc in late August of 2018\r\n+ https://github.com/joyent/node-ldapjs/issues/483 -- fundamental API method doesn't work with Node 10 since early June of 2018. PRs to fix it are ignored (https://github.com/joyent/node-ldapjs/pull/497 and https://github.com/joyent/node-ldapjs/pull/485)\r\n\r\nPRs with popular backing are ignored:\r\n\r\n+ https://github.com/joyent/node-ldapjs/pull/399\r\n+ https://github.com/joyent/node-ldapjs/pull/466\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this issue is the right format, but @mcollina suggested I bring it here (https://twitter.com/matteocollina/status/1139655792997650434). I looked through the issues around suggesting packages and didn't see anything about a formal process.\r\n\r\nAgain, I'm not affiliated with this module. I just recognize that it fills a big role for the segment of the community it serves, and that it is time for some TLC be given to it. From the evidence presented here, I think it is a waste of time to try and wake the project up with its current leadership.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/221/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/221/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"list_id":4,"list_name":"Feedback"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/223","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/223/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/223/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/223/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/223","id":456760706,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTY3NjA3MDY=","number":223,"title":"[Support

The support levels doc has a [support `target` field](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/blob/master/docs/drafts/Baseline%20practice%20-%20Document%20support%20levels.md#support-target), which references the node version support policy that the package aims to provide (as well as several \"unsupported\" options)\r\n- As discussed in #205, CI systems would ideally be able to define the list of node versions to test in as a single policy keyword\r\n- Renovate provides [a way to configure the support policy](https://renovatebot.com/docs/node/#configuring-support-policy) for automatically updating node version reference files (`engines` in `package.json`, `.travis.yml` matrix, `.nvmrc`)\r\n\r\nNot sure if it is in scope for this group to standardize such a grammar or whether this discussion should be moved elsewhere, but renovate's grammar is a reasonable starting point `*`, so at the very least we might want to discuss if we should adopt it for the `support-target` field `**`:\r\n\r\n\r\n| supportPolicy | versions   | description                                              |\r\n| ------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| all           | 8,10,11,12 | All releases that have not passed their end date         |\r\n| lts           | 8,10       | All releases classified as LTS, including in maintenance |\r\n| active        | 10,12      | All releases not in maintenance                          |\r\n| lts_active    | 10         | All releases both LTS and active                         |\r\n| lts_latest    | 10         | The latest LTS release                                   |\r\n| current       | 12         | The latest release from \"all\"                            |\r\n\r\n([source](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/master/website/docs/node.md))\r\n\r\nI believe `lts_latest` in renovate's dictionary is equivalent to `lts/*` in `nvm`, but it does need (as well as `nvm`) a way to specify \"oldest supported LTS\" (and similar).\r\n\r\nI'm also aware some people like to test/support down to minor and even patch level of node, but I'm not sure there's a need for a grammar to reference them.\r\n\r\nAs much as I'm reluctant to go provider specific, there is also the case of AWS Lambda, which is usually several minor version behind latest, so this might be useful to include in the keyword list (at the cost of simplicity...)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- `*` - I have to admit that I do think that current language used in terms of \"active\" vs \"lts\" vs \"maintenance lts\" releases is rather complex and has mislead people in the past, but at this point I do not have concrete suggestions on how to improve it... And that's probably outside of scope of this group anyways.\r\n- `**` - I wonder how would this transfer to other ecosystems and whether we should aim for a more abstract `support-target` field, which is closer to a dictionary a la `engines` in `package.json`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/236/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/237","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/237/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/237/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/237/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/237","id":477887599,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0Nzc4ODc1OTk=","number":237,"title":"Node.js

This requirements means that publishing from CI is difficult because it requires the CI to have a OTP from the user.  In order to maintain the 2FA you need some third party setup (a api to orchestrate the 2FA).  @dominykas and the team at Near Form have done some exploratory work on this with [Optic](https://github.com/nearform/optic/).  This situation is even more complicated for teams managing publish access (like we want for Express).\r\n\r\nThe POC solves well the CI portion for a single maintainer, but it requires a infrastructure which I am not sure is best long term for OSS projects. It uses web push, so requires a Firebase account.  Any infrastructure requirement is complicated for typical OSS maintainers. This is also vendor lock in.\r\n\r\nIn looking for options for a setup in Express, @dominykas and I hoped on a call to discuss.  The outcome from that call was that we identified one clear best case scenario:\r\n\r\nNpm builds a release manager which supports 2FA.  So the idea would be that when CI pushed a release, it would be held in a pending state if it requires 2FA but no OTP was provided. You could then visit the website to see a list of pending releases. There you provide your 2FA OTP upon \"approving\" the release.\r\n\r\nI am sure there are design and technical considerations to this approach, but we thought we should bring it up here and see what people think about this proposed solution.  There are other approaches we discussed, and if I have time I will follow up with descriptions of those, but I wanted to get this posted to open up the conversation

Do we want \"WG supported packages\"? Do we just want them in the nodejs org on github? Are we alright just letting them live under the person who wrote the best (sadly often first mover biased) solution?\r\n\r\nI setup a GH Org and registered the corresponding npm scope `pkgjs` because I wanted to start working on concrete implementations of the ideas we were discussing.  I am happy to offer that up to the group as an option, but I recognize that there are also downsides to a \"random\" named GH org/scope.\r\n\r\nThe upsides I have so far is the ability to build things quickly and get them out there.  Which we might not have as easily if it was all in the node org.  I also personally like the idea of a scope dedicated to JS package maintainers and tools to make it all easier.  \r\n\r\nAnyone else have thoughts on

(and maybe even making some new ones! 🎉 )\r\n\r\n## Proposal (WIP)\r\nThe proposal here is to explore the ideas discussed during the session and follow those threads where they may lead, in particular around finding opportunities around automation, tooling, and ultimately, _ease the burden of maintenance for for maintainers_.\r\n\r\nOf great interest is cross pollinating tooling being developed and maintained by the NodeJS Release WG, in particular looking at tools like [**citgm**](https://github.com/nodejs/citgm), which the NodeJS teams uses to assess the impact of changes on the wider community at large, by building certain projects _against_ new / nightly builds of NodeJS itself.\r\n\r\nFor example, a project like Express may want to build against key projects and packages _within_ its own ecosystem on a nightly basis against master, to ensure there aren't breaking changes in a scenario outside of an expected semver major release.  (the interval used is just an example)\r\n\r\n## Thoughts / Questions / Considerations\r\n- Given the high visibility and foundational support of NodeJS, it seems like there is a lot of opportunities to use and build off of what the NodeJS Release WG is already doing either by: \r\n  1. increasing visibility of existing tools already used and automating more of the NodeJS process\r\n  1. Sharing the results of those efforts with the community, ideally through CI based tooling (e.g. GitHub Actions, see below).\r\n- How do we measure and determine what's worth automating and also what could be leveraged from **GitHub**, like with GitHub Actions, or maybe in conjunction with npm, so that as many projects as possible can benefit with little lift / effort on their part, but with immediate value add a reduced burden to their project's overall maintenance.\r\n- What expectations from the community itself may we want to assert, e.g. if we build Express nightly, but all the ecosystem tools are mocking all the Express APIs, how effective will nightly **citgm**  based builds actually be?\r\n- Are there opportunities for parallelization of our efforts here?  It would be great to think of a few different approaches and let teams / groups / WG try them out and report back, and we can guide our efforts based on those results.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is just a start and hopefully I captured the spirit, ambition, and voice of the room and so happy to help get this conversation started.  I am personally looking to get involved in the NodeJS release process and trying to help with automation there, and would be happy to help bridge and be a liaison between these two WGs (Release + Package Maintainers) and try and maximize the efforts (and minimize the overlap) of both teams.\r\n\r\nThanks for a great event and looking forward to continuing the conversation!  👋 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/299/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/299/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"list_id":4,"list_name":"Feedback"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/301","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/301/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/301/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/301/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/301","id":539806237,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1Mzk4MDYyMzc=","number":301,"title":"Question: Is this part of a baseline practice?

Overview\r\nComing out of the recent WG meeting (#305), one of the topics that came up while discussing the Express project was [an issue](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/233) started by @wesleytodd to help establish repo owners for the project, who could help maintain the code base and its packages, and share in the responsibilities as it relates to help with triage / review / and general code ownership.\r\n\r\nIt was reasoned that having something like this, even in a generic fashion, or like picking a OSS license for the model that best suits your needs, can help package maintainers deal with the influx of attention popular packages can attract and as such, can help with not only ensuring successful technical maintenance / growth of the project itself, but also alleviate the burden on the maintainer(s).\r\n\r\nThat said, this is not intended to be a one size fits all endeavor per se, and so casting a wide net certainly helps us cover as many use cases as possible, even if maintainers just end up cherry-picking from the content that gets derived as the result of this work here.  At least being able to provide a resource / reference / starting point could be a very valuable tool in a toolkit for package maintainers.  \r\n\r\n## Proposal (TBD)\r\nWhile there are probably some generally useful recommendations that can be applied by all / most packages, ultimately authors would be encouraged to best adopt a model / policy that best supports their particular package if no one particular size fits.\r\n\r\nSome examples of recommendations that could come out of an effort like this are:\r\n1. Create a _contributing.md_, if you don't already have it to document the model you want (good first step in general for articulating the vision of how you would like your project to operate, to better guide further technical / operational decisions)\r\n1. Use GitHub's [Code Owner's feature](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners)\r\n1. Take advantage of project / Issue planning (i.e. using Project's and Milestone's to guide visibility into priorities / roadmap).  Also good to have documented in the README\r\n1. Take advantage of GitHub bots / CI to help with code review and issue triaging\r\n1. Using branch protections / teams to administer repos, auto assign PRs, etc\r\n\r\nFrom a per project perspective, and given size, actually advancing / promoting contributors (if at all) would have another related of policies as well.  How would one measure the contributions of a contributor?   (an interesting point covered in the Express PR I linked to).  Time?  commits?  comments?  All of the above?  These sorts of decisions could vary greatly from project to project,  but if any consistent themes emerge, certainly we can try and provide some general purpose guidelines.\r\n\r\nEither way, understanding that the technical side and interpersonal side of things may (and should?) be handled differently and so accounting for those distinctions may be helpful from the outset.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Next Steps / Feedback\r\n\r\nI think a good next step would be to review some of the high impact projects in the community (in the OpenJS Foundation) to see if there are some good resources / examples already in place that we can start from.  Projects like:\r\n* webpack\r\n* Express\r\n* NodeJS\r\n* others (jquery, mocha, ESLint)\r\n\r\nHearing / seeing from the community and what they've tried and found success with (or lack thereof) will allow us to not have to start in a vacuum.  Some questions / metrics to consider as this happens could be:\r\n- Size of the project (LOC / packages / repos?)\r\n- Avg. commits / PR (per month?)\r\n- What are you using now, if anything, for your project?\r\n- Is the project using any sort of CI / automation for PRs / issue triaging\r\n- Is there something that you wish you had from the community (tooling, methodologies, docs, etc)\r\n- Are there any SLAs already in place?\r\n\r\nWould also be a good to follow along and absorb any relevant feedback from these package / project engagement efforts:\r\n- #142 \r\n- #143 \r\n- #144 \r\n\r\nFeedback welcome!  This is very much a starting point to get our ideas captured and written down and be used to build off of.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/309/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/309/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/310","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/310/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/310/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/310/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/310","id":553536312,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NTM1MzYzMTI=","number":310,"title":"Node.js

I'm not too familiar with other systems, but I'm sure they have something too. It would be nice to provide an official set of includes that people can just take and use, e.g. \"On Travis, use all LTS versions starting with v10 + current version\" (implementation details / naming convention / folder structure to be fleshed out with the first impl).\r\n\r\nSo we need to make some decisions first:\r\n\r\n1. Where do all of these things live:\r\n    - it could be one repository, with a folder per CI system\r\n        - this might not work, if the CI system expects files in the root folder of the repo\r\n        - this might result in lots of churn in the repo\r\n    - it could be a repository per CI system\r\n        - this does add admin overhead for multiple repos\r\n        - this does add overhead for keeping the structure of the repos the same\r\n2.

I am not a member, but have been brought into the Express Triage effort based on what I believe were conversations that started here.\r\n\r\nI wanted to note that I have commented on [an issue](https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/2747#issuecomment-593608470) at the Axios repo, mentioning to them the existence of this working group. \r\n\r\n**I hope that was okay, and I apologize if I have stepped out of line in doing so.**\r\n\r\nMy intent in filing this issue with you is to hopefully start a dialogue between these two projects, if both are willing ❤️ \r\n\r\nI was motivated by seeing the current state of their project. They seem to have put in work at some point in terms of creating [collaborator guidelines](https://github.com/axios/axios) and have brought folks in on an ad hoc basis. However, I get the feeling they could use some help, and they are currently sitting at a non-trivial amount of open issues and PRs.\r\n\r\nI commented on an issue that a self-motivated community member created (@chinesedfan), who it seems has been doing a lot of triage work. That same community member had shared the following [comment](https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/1965#issuecomment-580177276) in a thread asking if the project was dead, and I think it shows very succinctly the challenges of getting involved and the value that sanctioning Triage can bring to a project:\r\n\r\n> Share a personal story and some news for users in this thread,\r\n> \r\n> * I noticed the situation of axios like you guys in Feb 2019 and triaged about 30 issues+pulls.\r\n> * Got no responses from the maintainers and felt a little disappointed. But still kept an eye on it.\r\n> * Luckily, I was invited as a collaborator in Dec 2019. That started my issue killer time. Total issues have decreased from ~600 to less than 300 now.\r\n> \r\n> I created a plan for the next release. See [axios/axios/projects/4](https://github.com/axios/axios/projects/4). I know there are still some problems in axios, but I hope we can fix those hottest first.\r\n> \r\n> I don't need your words to pay too much time on it, but would someone mind helping review those features when you are free, to make the next release better?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf their project is open to it, I think they could benefit from some of the learning that has been happening in the Express Triage, as well as the other conversations happening in this working group.\r\n\r\nI see there was a prior issue https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/239 created about the possibility of reaching out to them.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/322/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/322/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/323","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/323/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/323/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/323/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/323","id":574335077,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NzQzMzUwNzc=","number":323,"title":"Idea: #236 Standard grammar for node release lines and security","user":{"login":"wesleytodd","id":1027776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjc3NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1027776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleytodd","html_url":"https://github.com/wesleytodd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleytodd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleytodd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleytodd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleytodd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleytodd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleytodd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleytodd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleytodd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wesleytodd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2020-03-03T00:17:51Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T18:09:05Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I propose an addition to the alias specification:\r\n\r\n> An alias should never resolve to a version of Node.js with known security vulnerabilities\r\n\r\nThis would require that implementations of the alias's would need a way to look up which versions of Node have known security issues.

Those support node modules are scoped with the company name in their internal registry.  This way, all the customer has to do is add a little something to a .npmrc file saying to install any @companyName modules from that registry.  This isn't anything new,  and i believe it is documented on npm's site.\r\n\r\nThe scenario I was thinking about, was what if the company also \"owns\" the @companyName scope on the upstream npm,  and want to publish something there, either a \"blank module\" with just a readme, or maybe a mocked function that returns an error that maybe gives some information on how to get the supported version of the module.  I can see this happening if the customer forgets to add the proper entry into an .npmrc file or if a user is searching.\r\n\r\nHas anyone in this group run into this scenario, or have thoughts on it?  I wasn't sure what npm's terms were related to this sort of thing.  I know when the core-js module was outputting ads during npm installs many people were getting upset.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/329/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/331","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/331/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/331/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/331/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/331","id":587650979,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1ODc2NTA5Nzk=","number":331,"title":"discussion with NPM on depenedent module statistics","user":{"login":"ghinks","id":5049078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDkwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5049078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghinks","html_url":"https://github.com/ghinks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghinks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghinks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghinks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghinks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghinks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghinks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghinks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghinks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghinks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2020-03-25T12:10:00Z","updated_at":"2020-04-03T20:38:19Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Although we are looking into [dependency tooling](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/327) currently. I would like to engage @darcyclarke @ahmadnassri @ruyadorno in order to see if any existing module dependency statistics could be made available to the maintenance team while we develop tooling.\r\n\r\nThe basic issue we wish to solve \r\n\r\n**How do we find the top modules that depend on a module we are starting to maintain?**\r\n\r\nI am taking this from a very practical perspective and an example helps. The [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) module has over 3k dependents. I am starting to triage that module as part of the express triage team. We are forming the framework for repo captains who can help manage different repositories within the express eco system.\r\n\r\nThere are many 3rd party module dependencies and some of them I can guess are more important than others. eg\r\n\r\n- [connect-redis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-redis)\r\n- [connect-mongo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-mongo)\r\n\r\nhowever I am being biased and looking for the modules I think of. There are most likely hundreds of modules that connect to DB storage that use the [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) module. \r\n\r\n**Would it be possible to get an ordered dependency list from the registry folks and is there a better way to do this than scrapping the registry?**\r\n\r\nAs we start to maintain import libraries in the eco-system we will have to test changes in the dependents. Without clear understanding of what modules are important this will lead to de-stabilization through well intentioned maintenance changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/331/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/331/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"list_id":4,"list_name":"Feedback"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/334","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/334/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/334/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/334/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/334","id":591871875,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1OTE4NzE4NzU=","number":334,"title":"Node.js

All,\r\n\r\nWe are in the process of implementing kafka and CMAK (previously known as \"kafka manager\") to our work flow to better organize the communication between our applications, apparently after starting CMAK we are unable to reassing our topics (total 1700) to other brokers, we have configured one cluster with 5 brokers.\r\n\r\nReplication of issue is as follows by accessing CMAK on port 9000 and choosing a cluster, under the \"Cluster Summary\" bar information about the total amount of Topics and Brokers will be displayed, by selecting the total amount of Topics you will be transferred to the \"Operations\" tab under \"Topics\", from that tab select \"Run Partition Assignments\", the next screen will represent the total list of topics and option which to be choose, in our case we want to move all of our 1700 Topics, sadly after clicking the \"Run Partition Assignments\" button at the bottom of the page we receive \"Bad Request 413 - For request 'Post

maxChunkSize in the application.conf file of CMAK, but the issue remained.\r\n\r\nWe are using CMAK version \"3.0.0.4\" and kafka \"2.5.0\", could you please assist us in resolving the issue, how can

up some questions from https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/348 and things we discussed in the meetings. I think this one is probably for legal, right @mhdawson?\r\n\r\n- The (c) authors part in some `LICENSE` templates says e.g. \"ci-travis-config contributors\", in some others it says \"Copyright Node.js contributors\". Can we stick to just \"Copyright Node.js contributors.\" (so that it's easy to copy/paste the `LICENSE` file) or does it have to spell out each repo name?\r\n    - We can probably skip the year, as the main license file doesn't have it?\r\n- The `ci-config-*` repos have the `AUTHORS` file added there. Is that file necessary?\r\n    - The list of contributors is always there in the git history? We can probably enforce that the `master` cannot be overwritten?\r\n    - If the file is actually necessary - does the org already have a tool to generate it? Are there any rules around what should go into it? Can we simply add a link to the Github \"Contributors\" tab and be done with it or does it have to be provider agnostic and have an actual list of people?\r\n- In some cases we have a link to that `AUTHORS` file from the `LICENSE`.

and document a standard operating procedure, or some sort of expectation of what this group can provide.

This section could be called \"Resources\"?  I am not too picky about the name, tbh.\r\n\r\nIt should / could contain\r\n1. Any specific policies, expectations of the team, etc\r\n1.

You can read up on that here if you'd like: \r\nhttps://medium.com/@nodejs/call-to-action-accelerating-node-js-growth-e4862bee2919.\r\n\r\nThis blog is a call to action for package maintainers in order to help in one of our initiatives\r\nand to move it forward, we need your help.\r\n\r\nIt's been almost 2 years and we've been working on a number initiatives which you can\r\nlearn more about through the issues in the [package-maintenance repo](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance).\r\nThings never move quite as fast as we'd like, but we are making progress on a number of different\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nOne area that we identified was:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBuilding and documenting guidance, tools and processes that businesses can use\r\nto identify packages on which they depend, and then to use this information to\r\nbe able to build a business case that supports their organization and developers\r\nhelping to maintain those packages.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe started by looking at how to close the gap between maintainers and consumers in\r\nterms of expecations. Mismatched expectations can often be a source of friction\r\nand by providing a way to communicate the level of support behind a package we\r\nbelieve we can:\r\n\r\n* help maintainers communicate the level of support they can/want to provide, which\r\n  versions of Node.js they plan to support going forward and the current level backing\r\n  in place to help keep development of the package moving forward.\r\n* reduce potential friction due to mismatched expectations between module maintainers\r\n  and consumers\r\n* help consumers better understand the packages they depend on so that they can\r\n  improve their planning and manage risk.\r\n  \r\nIn terms of managing risk we hope that by helping consumers better understand the\r\nkey packages they depend on, it will encourage them to support these packages in \r\none or more ways:\r\n * encouraging their employees to help with the ongoing maintenance\r\n * provide funding to the existing maintainers\r\n * support the Foundation the packages are part of (for example the OpenJS Foundation)\r\n \r\nAfter discussion at one of the Node.js collaborator summits were there was good support for\r\nthe concept, the team has worked to define some additional metadata reference in the package.json in\r\norder to allow mainainters to communicate this information.\r\n\r\nThe detailed specification for this data can be found in: https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/blob/master/docs/PACKAGE-SUPPORT.md.\r\n\r\nThe TL/DR version is that it allows the maintainer to communicate:\r\n* target: the platform versions that the package maintainer aims to support. This is different\r\n  from then existing `engines` field in that expresses a higher level intent like `current LTS version`\r\n  for which the specific versions can change over time.\r\n* response: how quickly the maintainer chooses to, or is able to, respond to issues and contacts for that level of support\r\n* backing: how the project is supported, and how consumers can help support the project.\r\n\r\nWe completed the specificaion a while ago, but before asking maintainers to start adding the\r\nsupport information we wanted to provide some tooling to help validate that the information added\r\nwas complete and valid.  We've just finished the version version of that tool which is called\r\n[support](https://github.com/pkgjs/support). \r\n\r\nThe tool currently offers two commands which can be used which are:\r\n* show \r\n* validate\r\n\r\nThe `show` commands displays a simple tree of the packages for an application and the raw support information\r\nfor those packages. Much more sophisticated commands will make sense to help consumers review/understand the\r\nsupport info but at this point its more important to start to have the information filled in, as that is needed\r\nbefore more sophisticated analysis makes sense.\r\n\r\nThe `validate` command helps maintainers validate that the've added/defined the support information correctly.\r\nIf there are errors or omissions it will let the maintainer know so that as support information is added it\r\nis high quality and complete.\r\n\r\nOur call to action is for package maintainers to:\r\n\r\n* Review the support [specification](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/blob/master/docs/PACKAGE-SUPPORT.md) and give us your feedback if you have suggestion/comments.\r\n* Add support info to your package\r\n* Use the support tool in order to validate the support info and give us feedback on the tool\r\n* Let us know when you've added support info so that we can keep track of how well we are doing\r\n  in terms of the ecosystem supporting the initiative, as well as knowing which real-world\r\n  packages we can use/reference when building additional functionality into the support tool.\r\n  \r\nWe hope to see the ecosystem start to provide this information and look forward to seeing what\r\ntooling people (including the package-maintenance working group and others) come up with to help\r\nachieve the goals outlined.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n

Or possibly make one last release to call one from the other?\r\n\r\ncc @Eomm ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/401/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"list_id":4,"list_name":"Feedback"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/402","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/402/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/402/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/402/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/402","id":689425994,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2ODk0MjU5OTQ=","number":402,"title":"Adding Package Maintenance to NodeJS website","user":{"login":"rxmarbles","id":9443787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NDM3ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9443787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles","html_url":"https://github.com/rxmarbles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1183339013,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTgzMzM5MDEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/labels/package-maintenance-agenda","name":"package-maintenance-agenda","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":"Agenda items for package-maintenance team"},{"id":1527439247,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTI3NDM5MjQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"e5894b","default":false,"description":"The decision process is still ongoing"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rxmarbles","id":9443787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NDM3ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9443787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles","html_url":"https://github.com/rxmarbles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rxmarbles","id":9443787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NDM3ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9443787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles","html_url":"https://github.com/rxmarbles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxmarbles/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2020-08-31T18:57:08Z","updated_at":"2020-09-09T23:13:43Z","closed_at":"2020-09-09T23:13:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I am working on a PR to add our WG to the nodejs website however looking at our README for about this group and our repsonsibilities it seems a bit outdated.

**EDIT by @boneskull: This issue has been moved to pkgjs/create#9; please comment there**\r\n\r\nRecently, I was able to transfer the ownership of the `create-pkg` package over to the `@pkgjs` org on **npmjs.com**. The hope here is that this namespace/package can serve as tooling to scaffold new projects with whatever defaults this group wants to define & be unblocked by `npm`-specific defaults in `npm init`.\r\n\r\n@wesleytodd @ruyadorno & I got together the other day to discuss this a bit more & here's some of the notes from that discussion:\r\n\r\n> **Note:** We'd love input & to have a broader discussion about how/what we could build\r\n\r\n## `create-pkg`\r\n\r\n### Goals:\r\n1. Provide a tool that promotes sane package defaults (defined by PMWG)\r\n1. Provide tools to extend defaults per community/team\r\n\r\n#### Example Usage:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm init pkg\r\n$ npx create-pkg\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst pkg = require('create-pkg')\r\nimport pkg from 'create-pkg'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n\r\n1. ***What do we want the scaffold output to include?***\r\n    * `package.json`\r\n        * `name`\r\n        * `description`\r\n        * `homepage`\r\n        * `author`\r\n        * `license`\r\n        * `funding`\r\n        * `version`\r\n        * `type`\r\n        * `main`\r\n        * `scripts`\r\n            * `\"prepublish\": \"...\"`* (contentious)\r\n            * `\"test\": \"...\"`* (contentious)\r\n        * `exports`\r\n    * `index.js`\r\n    * `LICENSE`\r\n    * `CONTRIBUTING.md`\r\n    * `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`\r\n    * `README.md`\r\n    * `FUNDING.yml`* (contentious)\r\n    * `.npmrc`* (contentious)\r\n    * `.gitignore`* (contentious)\r\n        * Contents: `/node_modules`\r\n    * `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES/*`* (contentious)\r\n1. ***What API surface do we want to expose to both end users and folks who want to compose the base generator with their own custom opinions?***\r\n    * Interfaces: CLI w/ Interactive/Prompts & a JS API\r\n\r\n### Next Steps:\r\n* Get some general consensus of the approach we'd like to take building this & the defaults we'd want\r\n* Update `@pkgjs/support` to be a consumer of this tool or vice-versa\r\n\r\n### References & Prior Art:\r\n* Github gitignore: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Node.gitignore\r\n* Collection user input: https://github.com/wesleytodd/opta\r\n* Yeoman\r\n* Plop\r\n* `npm init x` (ie. `$ npx create-x`)\r\n* And probably many many more scaffolding tools/generators...\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/404/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/404/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/405","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/405/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/405/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/405/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/405","id":695839593,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2OTU4Mzk1OTM=","number":405,"title":"Node.js

It could be named \"buildDependencies\". \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nDevelopment dependencies contain tools like Eslint, Webpack development server, static server and many others which isn't required on a build stage. This affects the final installation size and increases the time updated code spends in CI/CD. Also it creates extra load on disk and network to download and store megabytes of redundant code.\r\n\r\nAlso it lets developers to create all-in-one packages which contain build and development tools simultaneously. What affects the size of this packages.\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n* Faster CI/CD.\r\n* More compact installations.\r\n* Costs reduction.\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\n* Such solution requires separation of build and dev configuration files for tools like Gulp or Grunt to avoid dependencies import issues.\r\n* Requires Yarn, PNPM and NPM implement this feature all together.\r\n* Requires learning to use new option or automation to prevent dependency

played around with this a little bit, and since the only re-usable primitive in Github Actions is a `step` packaged as an \"action\", the only possible implementation to have an auto-updating matrix is something like this:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\njobs:\r\n  prepare-node-matrix:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    outputs:\r\n      matrix: ${{ steps.set-matrix.outputs.matrix }}\r\n    steps:\r\n      - uses: nodejs/ci-config-github-actions@master\r\n        id: set-matrix\r\n        with:\r\n          gte: 10\r\n          policy: lts\r\n\r\n  test:\r\n    needs: prepare-node-matrix\r\n    strategy:\r\n      matrix:\r\n        node-version: ${{ fromJson(needs.prepare-node-matrix.outputs.matrix) }}\r\n```\r\n\r\n1️⃣ Which is suuuuuuuper verbose? Did I miss something? What do people do to solve this issue - do they generate actions or smth from templates? Would we need a CLI or smth to help with that generation? I can't imagine someone copy/pasting that across hundreds of repos in an organization?\r\n\r\n2️⃣ It also makes wonder if it's worth maintaining an action, when instead of the `uses: nodejs/ci-config-github-actions@master` block (5 lines) you could `run: npx @pkgjs/node-matrix --gte 10 --policy lts` instead?\r\n\r\n3️⃣ But if we are to keep the action - should we rename the repo to something that follows the action convetion better, e.g. `nodejs/version-matrix-action`?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/416/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/417","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/417/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/417/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/417/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/417","id":721408890,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MjE0MDg4OTA=","number":417,"title":"Node.js

Are some in progress?\r\n- How is work coordinated between here (e.g., a tracking issue) and the `pkgjs` org repos?  \r\n- Is there a process for creating a new repo in the `pkgjs` org?  \r\n- Is there a plan for promotion of the new tools created in the `pkgjs` org?  We may have good tools, but how do we get them in front of users?\r\n\r\nWhile I'm sure some of these questions can be answered here, I'm going to guess that some of them are best discussed on a call,

Permissions for policies currently are limited to integrity checks on the files (preventing the file write described in [the event-stream breakdown](https://schneider.dev/blog/event-stream-vulnerability-explained/)), or limiting what modules can be accessed via `import`/`require` preventing things like a text parser spawning child processes directly.\r\n\r\nThis means that there should be:\r\n\r\n1. some way to persist these permissions across installs / updates\r\n   1. ideally diff the changes\r\n1. some way to list the current permissions\r\n\r\nI propose we look into adding a field to `package.json` to specify what a package is expecting to be granted. This is likely much different from the policy file itself since it doesn't need to do things like list the integrity of each file and would not contain the resolution of its dependencies to prevent redirecting to other modules. So while a policy would have these specifics, a package likely only wants to list the extern modules it can access pre-resolution and list if files are not expecting to be integrity checked.\r\n\r\nUnlike lock files which guard install time, this is meant generate the guards for run time. Node core can enforce the guards and be expanded for more guards as needed.\r\n\r\nI am open to any designs to suit package managers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/436/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/436/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","list_id":5,"list_name":"Closed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/437","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/437/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/437/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/437/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/437","id":760312326,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3NjAzMTIzMjY=","number":437,"title":"Node.js

There are other features requested (incl. PRs open) that don't seem to be getting the attention they deserve.\r\n\r\nShould Node.js have an official action of its own?\r\n\r\nThis way we could implement the keywords support, and possibly we could recommend a different default matrix to the users.\r\n\r\nThe default matrix does have a tradeoff - right now,\r\n a maintainer has to add new versions each time, if we recommended, say `[ lts-1, lts, latest ]` as the default, then the tested versions would drop off without notice, but I figure that testing in latest versions is more valuable than testing in unsupported versions, even if breaking that support means the need to bump semver major.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated: #416

Now, I know there's going to be some opinions, but I figure maybe we should start with a baseline action (`checkout` -> `setup-node` -> `npm install` / `npm ci` -> `npm test`), just the very basics - what Travis used to do - and if we're happy - move that to the Node.js org? Alternatively, we may want to split into more advanced actions (e.g. separate test + lint).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the composite actions do not allow conditionals inside (as of yet), but it's possible to work around that, and I figure that having some code to discuss is probably better than having a lengthy discussion in the issue here, so hence I think we should just create the new repo and discuss there :)\r\n\r\nSeems they also do not allow a matrix inside, but hopefully https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/98 will come soon...\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nReminder from [Governance.md](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/blob/main/Governance.md):\r\n\r\n> Any member may request the management of repositories within the Pkgjs GitHub Organization by opening an issue in the package-maintenance repository.\r\n> [..]\r\n> Provided there are no objections from any members raised in the issue, such requests are approved automatically after 72 hours.

They are not keeping up with the new Node.js features.**\r\n\r\nBesides the common OSS sustainability issues, I see a strong connection with the culture of Node.js core in 2012-2014. Around 2013/2014, the Node.js project was in a terrible state. The number of users was exploding, the number of active maintainers was declining. Node.js was running in many production envs, yet its version was still pre-1.0 (0.10, to be specific).\r\n\r\nThe ecosystem was mirroring the situation in Node.js core. Many of the most popular packages were maintained by less than a handful of developers. They were quickly getting to the point where they could not sustain support load from the fast-growing number of users.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, the io.js fork happened. It was a big earthquake and took a lot of effort from many people and companies to clean up. Eventually, the new Node.js project emerged with more open contribution & governance policies.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there was no such event in the npm ecosystem.\r\n\r\n**Many packages that become popular in Node.js 0.8-0.10 days are still stuck in the mindset of the Node.js project of that era. Too many users, too few active maintainers, no hope for improvement.**\r\n\r\nThis poses many risks and issues:\r\n- If a security vulnerability is reported in a popular dependency, how quickly a patched version will be released?\r\n- Many packages are migrating to ES Module style only, dropping support for CommonJS consumers. Packages written in CommonJS are going to stop receiving updates (including security fixes) from dependencies that moved to ESM.\r\n- Node.js core features like `AsyncLocalStorage` and `diagnostics_channel` require a bit of help from modules to work correctly. E.g. packages implementing thread pools (DB clients) and custom queues (legacy Promise implementations) need to restore async context.\r\n- Many of the popular packages have very sub-optimal performance (e.g. Winston, Bunyan, but also Express). Modern alternatives (e.g. Pino) have much less overhead. \r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nSo, what can Node.js users do about it? Vote by their feet and choose dependencies backed by an active & diverse community.  This applies not only to modules listed in project dependencies. It's even more important to show modern tools in the documentation and code examples.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this modernization is progressing slowly. There is a kind of a vicious cycle: a lot of existing content shows legacy packages, thus people assume that's what everybody uses. As a result, they show the same legacy packages when they write new content (blog posts, user manuals). Here is a semi-recent example: https://medium.com/airtable-eng/investigating-node-js-performance-event-loop-and-network-i-o-part-2-e9d1a8d4da8a\r\n\r\n**I'd like to open a discussion on how can the Node.js project help to accelerate modernization efforts?**\r\n\r\nLet's keep the discussion constructive and positive.\r\n- We should acknowledge the role of projects like Express, Bluebird and Winston in the history of the Node.js ecosystem, Node.js would not reach its current popularity without them.\r\n- Please stay respectful to the maintainers of these projects. Working in a popular open-source project is extremely demanding, I am grateful for all the effort they have been putting into their projects.\r\n- Let's focus on where want to get (and why), not on what we want to leave behind.\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/bajtos/status/1493193807621468165\r\n(The Twitter thread that started this whole idea.)\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/matteocollina/status/1483905860476801024\r\n> most people still code Node like it is 2013.\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/bengl/status/1484609453685104643\r\n> > Back in continuation-local-storage days, maintainers were not always keen to fix CLS support because CLS was not a part of Node.js core. Now that `AsyncResource` is official, I think it's reasonable to expect all modules to support it.\r\n>\r\n> Maybe, but also most of the modules where this really matters are abandonware, but still in heavy use in the wild.\r\n\r\n**Data points**\r\n\r\n|package|weekly downloads Jan 2022| Feb 2022| notes|\r\n|-|--:|-|-|\r\n| bluebird | 23.8M | 25.6M | No release since 2019 |\r\n| request | 20.6M |

I took some notes as I was exploring it, which you can find raw [here](https://gist.github.com/bnb/d15a8ff30c60f7c3cd47295932a64d52). However, I'd like to refine them and share my issues/concerns with the `node` namespace values:\r\n\r\n- Currently, there is inconsistency in how the values are named.\r\n  - `lts` is equivalent to `lts_all` if we're looking at the naming of both `all` and `lts_latest`/`lts_active`. We have two naming schemes side by side - effectively, we've implemented both a flat structure and a tiered structure, and the intersection of those two is messy.\r\n- `active` is particularly problematic since it co-opts existing terminology.\r\n  - `Active` is terminology already adopted by the release working group for LTS releases. `active` in the context of this includes both (Release WG terminology) `current` and `active LTS`, which does not help clarify the already confusing state that we exist within.\r\n- Certain matrix combinations are missing.\r\n  - Example: there's not a way for someone to say they only support maintenance LTS.\r\n  - Example: there's not a way for someone to say they only support EOL versions.\r\n  - While these examples may not be something we'd immediately consider as valid options, there are potentially scenarios where they'd be useful. For example, imagine a polyfill library that backfills all possible new Node.js features to maintenance mode LTS, or a package that intentionally logs a message on EOL verisons.\r\n\r\nRather than building out an incomplete structure (especially when we've collectively consistently struggled with naming release concepts in the past!) as a matrix, I'd like to propose that we simply take the elements of the matrix and directly support those as an array rather than a string.\r\n\r\n  - current\r\n  - lts/latest (alternate: `lts-latest`)\r\n  - lts/active (alternate: `lts-active`)\r\n  - lts/maintenance ((alternate: `lts-maintenance`)\r\n  - eol\r\n\r\nany combination of these achieves every option in the existing namespace:\r\n\r\n- all: `current, lts/active, lts/maintenance, eol`\r\n- lts: `lts/active, lts/maintenance`\r\n- lts_latest: `lts/latest`\r\n- supported: `current, lts/active, lts/maintenance`\r\n- current: `current`\r\n\r\nadditionally, some combinations not currently covered by the existing namespace are covered:\r\n\r\n- ones people might actually use:\r\n  - lts/maintenance\r\n  - eol\r\n- handful of others, but I can't imagine people using them.\r\n\r\nthe _only_ variation from the Release WG definition of release lines is `lts/latest` which is a subset that's independent of categories, rather than a combination of multiple categories.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/517/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"list_id":4,"list_name":"Feedback"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/518","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/518/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/518/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/518/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/518","id":1170932407,"node_id":"I_kwDOCW9pp85FywK3","number":518,"title":"Node.js

Node.js ecosystem has a major problem: many of the most popular npm packages don't have adequate maintenance activity. They are not keeping up with the new Node.js features.**\r\n\r\nBesides the common OSS sustainability issues, I see a strong connection with the culture of Node.js core in 2012-2014. Around 2013/2014, the Node.js project was in a terrible state. The number of users was exploding, the number of active maintainers was declining. Node.js was running in many production envs, yet its version was still pre-1.0 (0.10, to be specific).\r\n\r\nThe ecosystem was mirroring the situation in Node.js core. Many of the most popular packages were maintained by less than a handful of developers. They were quickly getting to the point where they could not sustain support load from the fast-growing number of users.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, the io.js fork happened. It was a big earthquake and took a lot of effort from many people and companies to clean up. Eventually, the new Node.js project emerged with more open contribution & governance policies.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there was no such event in the npm ecosystem.\r\n\r\n**Many packages that become popular in Node.js 0.8-0.10 days are still stuck in the mindset of the Node.js project of that era. Too many users, too few active maintainers, no hope for improvement.**\r\n\r\nThis poses many risks and issues:\r\n- If a security vulnerability is reported in a popular dependency, how quickly a patched version will be released?\r\n- Many packages are migrating to ES Module style only, dropping support for CommonJS consumers. Packages written in CommonJS are going to stop receiving updates (including security fixes) from dependencies that moved to ESM.\r\n- Node.js core features like `AsyncLocalStorage` and `diagnostics_channel` require a bit of help from modules to work correctly. E.g. packages implementing thread pools (DB clients) and custom queues (legacy Promise implementations) need to restore async context.\r\n- Many of the popular packages have very sub-optimal performance (e.g. Winston, Bunyan, but also Express). Modern alternatives (e.g. Pino) have much less overhead. \r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nSo, what can Node.js users do about it? Vote by their feet and choose dependencies backed by an active & diverse community.  This applies not only to modules listed in project dependencies. It's even more important to show modern tools in the documentation and code examples.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this modernization is progressing slowly. There is a kind of a vicious cycle: a lot of existing content shows legacy packages, thus people assume that's what everybody uses. As a result, they show the same legacy packages when they write new content (blog posts, user manuals). Here is a semi-recent example: https://medium.com/airtable-eng/investigating-node-js-performance-event-loop-and-network-i-o-part-2-e9d1a8d4da8a\r\n\r\n**I'd like to open a discussion on how can the Node.js project help to accelerate modernization efforts?**\r\n\r\nLet's keep the discussion constructive and positive.\r\n- We should acknowledge the role of projects like Express, Bluebird and Winston in the history of the Node.js ecosystem, Node.js would not reach its current popularity without them.\r\n- Please stay respectful to the maintainers of these projects. Working in a popular open-source project is extremely demanding, I am grateful for all the effort they have been putting into their projects.\r\n- Let's focus on where want to get (and why), not on what we want to leave behind.\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/bajtos/status/1493193807621468165\r\n(The Twitter thread that started this whole idea.)\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/matteocollina/status/1483905860476801024\r\n> most people still code Node like it is 2013.\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/bengl/status/1484609453685104643\r\n> > Back in continuation-local-storage days, maintainers were not always keen to fix CLS support because CLS was not a part of Node.js core. Now that `AsyncResource` is official, I think it's reasonable to expect all modules to support it.\r\n>\r\n> Maybe, but also most of the modules where this really matters are abandonware, but still in heavy use in the wild.\r\n\r\n**Data points**\r\n\r\n|package|weekly downloads Jan 2022| Feb 2022| notes|\r\n|-|--:|-|-|\r\n| bluebird | 23.8M | 25.6M | No release since 2019 |\r\n| request | 20.6M |

However, I'd like to refine them and share my issues/concerns with the `node` namespace values:\r\n\r\n- Currently, there is inconsistency in how the values are named.\r\n  - `lts` is equivalent to `lts_all` if we're looking at the naming of both `all` and `lts_latest`/`lts_active`. We have two naming schemes side by side - effectively, we've implemented both a flat structure and a tiered structure, and the intersection of those two is messy.\r\n- `active` is particularly problematic since it co-opts existing terminology.\r\n  - `Active` is terminology already adopted by the release working group for LTS releases. `active` in the context of this includes both (Release WG terminology) `current` and `active LTS`, which does not help clarify the already confusing state that we exist within.\r\n- Certain matrix combinations are missing.\r\n  - Example: there's not a way for someone to say they only support maintenance LTS.\r\n  - Example: there's not a way for someone to say they only support EOL versions.\r\n  - While these examples may not be something we'd immediately consider as valid options, there are potentially scenarios where they'd be useful. For example, imagine a polyfill library that backfills all possible new Node.js features to maintenance mode LTS, or a package that intentionally logs a message on EOL verisons.\r\n\r\nRather than building out an incomplete structure (especially when we've collectively consistently struggled with naming release concepts in the past!) as a matrix, I'd like to propose that we simply take the elements of the matrix and directly support those as an array rather than a string.\r\n\r\n  - current\r\n  - lts/latest (alternate: `lts-latest`)\r\n  - lts/active (alternate: `lts-active`)\r\n  - lts/maintenance ((alternate: `lts-maintenance`)\r\n  - eol\r\n\r\nany combination of these achieves every option in the existing namespace:\r\n\r\n- all: `current, lts/active, lts/maintenance, eol`\r\n- lts: `lts/active, lts/maintenance`\r\n- lts_latest: `lts/latest`\r\n- supported: `current, lts/active, lts/maintenance`\r\n- current: `current`\r\n\r\nadditionally, some combinations not currently covered by the existing namespace are covered:\r\n\r\n- ones people might actually use:\r\n  - lts/maintenance\r\n  - eol\r\n- handful of others, but I can't imagine people using them.\r\n\r\nthe _only_ variation from the Release WG definition of release lines is `lts/latest` which is a subset that's independent of categories, rather than a combination of multiple categories.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/517/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"list_id":4,"list_name":"Feedback"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/518","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/518/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/518/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/518/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/518","id":1170932407,"node_id":"I_kwDOCW9pp85FywK3","number":518,"title":"Node.js
